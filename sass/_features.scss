  // is stretched for two items in right hand(secure and location),
  // because of they are long headlines, we will have an empty line in bottomn of the headlines
  // and then these two texts are not aligned with other 6 texts.
  // with align-items: start; it will push icon, headline and text to the beginning of the page!
  // with align-items: end; it will push icon, headline and text to the end of the page!
  // IMPORTANT: we don't see any changes for other six items, they don't go to the top and bottomn
  // when i chnage the command from start to end and vice versa, because they are big enough!

  // grid-template-rows: auto auto; we don't need this, the compiler do it automatically!
  // it will create for us as implicit rows and not explicit - it is just enough to define
  // the columns, then it will create us the rows automatically!
